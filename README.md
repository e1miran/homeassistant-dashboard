YAML configuration of my Home Assistant lovelace dashboard UI

This repository includes the separate files that compose my dashboard. The main dashboard is dashboard.yaml which navigates to many sub-dashboards that contain distinct functionality.

__Some of the features that I'm most happy with and proud of__:

* Masthead includes swiping left/right to quickly see the front door cam or the driveway in order to see whose car is blocking whom.

* The camera view cycles through cameras surveillance-style (demo video is sped up during the camera view).

* Universal TV remotes that control Roku enabled TV's and related DirecTV boxes. Family members have access to the remote for the family room TV and their own bedroom TV.

* Certain lights (like bedroom lights) and buttons (such as the Admin view button) are only visible to appropriate family members.

* Multi-room audio interface that broadcasts certain streaming services and local radio streams (using Mopidy).
